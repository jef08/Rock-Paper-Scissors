This is the Rock-Paper-Scissors project from The Odin Project.
Designed to play 5 rounds.

Created buttons and images to choose from.
Changed the structure of the game so that the winner is whoever gets to five points first.
Would like to hard stop the game at 5 points and create a "play again?" button.
